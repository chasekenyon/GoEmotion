GoEmotion Sentiment Analysis with RoBERTa
In an effort to reimplement the below Google Research Paper for my NLP course project, I fine-tuned RoBERTa on the GoEmotions Dataset for fine-grained emotion recognition. While in the end, time and computing power limitations restricted my ability to tune hyperparameters effectively, resulting in a sub-optimal model, I learned a great deal about emotion recognition, NLP, and fine-tuning.
